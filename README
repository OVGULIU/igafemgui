This program provide a handy user interface to
Phu Vinh Nguyen FEM Octave code. This is used
to easily change some parameters and launch the
simulation without having to modify the sources.

* COMPILE
 To compile this program you need to install
 gtkmm 3.0 and libxml++ 2.6 

 You also need CMake.

 Go into the source directory, if you want to make
 a separate build directory then
 $ mkdir build && cd build
 then
 $ cmake ..

 If you did not create a build directory just
 $ cmake .

 In both cases run
 $ make

 And here you go

* USAGE
 Just type ./igafemgui to launch the program. At the first
 launch, a directory will be created in your home at
 ~/.igafemgui

 This will contain config.xml and a subfolder files/
 
 The files/ subfolder is used to store the information
 about the Octave scripts to be launched (for example some
 piece of description, a parameter list and some other
 stuff)

 You can edit two XML tags in the config file:
 	* basefem which contains all the FEM code
	* base file which should point to $HOME/.igafemgui/files
 You can also edit it via Configuration > Edit in the
 main window of the program.

 The developpement documentation for the program can be built
 using Doxygen. Type doxygen Doxyfile and then open
 doxygen/html/index.html to access the documentation
